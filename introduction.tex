    Regulatory bodies will require new softare features in order to effecivley and efficiently perform licensing activities for the next generation of reactor deigns.

        Closed codes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Raises barrier to reproducing results in scientific literature
            \item Most closed codes have decades of development experience -> more feature-rich, more code to maintain
            \item Educational/training resources may be more difficult to obtain
            \item May have to go through export control lisencing
        \end{itemize}

        Open codes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Lowers barrier to reproducing results in scientific literature
            \item Most open codes have less than a decade of development -> less feature-rich, more flexible when implementing new features
            \item Educational/training resources are easily accessible (if they exist)
            \item No need to go through export control
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Gls{ONCORE} initiative
        \item Open codes are better for:
        \item users, because their manuals/tutorials live in the open and can accept contributions on-the-fly
        \item developers, because they tend to require good practices during development 
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]
    \frametitle{How do you develop features in open codes?}
    Some useful tools include version control, open development workflow, and automation\footnote{These practices may also be used by closed code developers but there's no way to know for certain without asking them.}
