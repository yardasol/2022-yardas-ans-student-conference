    Regulatory bodies will require new softare features in order to effecivley and efficiently perform licensing activities for the next generation of reactor deigns.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Raises barrier to reproducing results in scientific literature
            \item Most closed codes have decades of development experience
            \item Educational/training resources may be more difficult to obtain
            \item May have to go through export control lisencing
        \end{itemize}

        \column[t]{5cm}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Lowers barrier to reproducing results in scientific literature
            \item Most open codes have less than a decade of development
            \item Educational/training resources are easily accessible, if they exist
            \item No need to go through export control
