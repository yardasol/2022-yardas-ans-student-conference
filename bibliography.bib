     abstract = {Modelling and simulation (M\&S) have gradually become irreplaceable tools in the field of Nuclear Science and           Technology ({NS}\&T), including nuclear energy systems. This is partly due to growing computational resources and advances in           computational science and partly to the difficulties to finance, build and license new experimental facilities. However, the            utilization of M\&S for research and development (R\&D) and education and training (E\&T) applications is somewhat hampered by limited  accessibility to controlled and sensitive nuclear M\&S tools as well as by the desires of the developers of these tools to retain       their intellectual property ({IP}). Open-source software and open-access data are growingly perceived as means to accelerate            innovation by promoting synergistic collaborative developments while lowering the barriers associated to code distribution,             modification, and sharing. Open-source software development is ideal for R\&D and E\&T purposes because it permits the enhancement of   understanding, the use of advanced computational methods and it promotes the cooperation among researchers and scientists, without      rigorous constraints on quality assurance or reliance on proprietary data for technology-specific validation. As a fundamental          research tool, this helps to mitigate constraints related to dual use of such technology. It is in this context that an initiative is   being launched under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency ({IAEA}) to promote the development and application of open-   source multi-physics simulation in support of R\&D and E\&T in {NS}\&T. This paper presents scope and objectives of this initiative.},

     abstract = {This paper gives an overview of OpenMC, an open source Monte Carlo particle transport code recently developed at the    Massachusetts Institute of Technology. OpenMC uses continuous-energy cross sections and a constructive solid geometry representation,   enabling high-fidelity modeling of nuclear reactors and other systems. Modern, portable input/output file formats are used in OpenMC:   XML for input, and HDF5 for output. High performance parallel algorithms in OpenMC have demonstrated near-linear scaling to over 100,   000 processors on modern supercomputers. Other topics discussed in this paper include plotting, CMFD acceleration, variance reduction,  eigenvalue calculations, and software development processes.},
