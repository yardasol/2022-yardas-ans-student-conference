    \begin{itemize}
        \item Open source software is becoming an important component of modeling and simulation for advanced reactors.
        \item Version control helps us keep track of changes and work on multiple features at once.
        \item Open development makes our code more robust and ensures new and external contributors can understand design and implementation desicions.
        \item Automating out repetitive tasks helps catch bugs and streamline the development workflow.
